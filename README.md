# microop.gg
This is a simple python program with a graphical interface. What this program does? Provides an analysis of your League of Legends account.

## How to use
Download the files to your computer, then run main.py. Input your username, tagline (without #), region and API key. Unfortunately, as of now the program only works for the European regions EUW and EUNE. I will probably add the other regions later. Furthermore, for the program to work, you will need to generate your own API key on the \href{https://developer.riotgames.com/}{Riot Developer Portal}.
